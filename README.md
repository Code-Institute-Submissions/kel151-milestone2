# GeekTrip

Milestone 2 Project: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

For my second milestone project, I choose to create a site in that would show the top 4 tourist spots in Tokyo, Japan, depending on whether the user was interested in anime and manga, or video games.  

## Demo

## UX
### User Stories
As someone who enjoys travel, I want to be able to find interesting locations to visit in Tokyo, Japan.<p>
As a fan of anime and manda, I want to know where in Japan to go to cater to my interest.<p>
As a fan of video games, I want to be able to find locations that pertain to video games.<p>
As someone who enjoys aesthetics, I want to view a sight that is both pleasing to the eye and on brand for the theme of "geeks" and "nerds".<p>

### Strategy
Tokyo is large city, known for many things such as food, fashion, technology, culture, etc. Through this milestone, I wanted to facilitate more specific interests and tailor the search for tourist spots to somewhat niche subjects. Therefore, my goal was to build a website that allowed the user to easily and swiftly find tourist pots in Tokyo, Japan, related to video games or anime and manga.<p>
  I wanted to keep the site quite basic, hence the choice of 3 sections, so as not to detract from purpose and design. The utilization of 3 sections helps to build narrative of the site and its purpose in the user's mind, and I feel that greatly aids in yielding more potent user story.<p>

### Scope
The purpose of this project was built a wesite that would show the suer the top 4 tourist spots in Tokyo, Japan, depending on whether they were interested in anime and manga or video games.<p>
 This project was also an opportunity for me to display my skill in HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as showcase a my comptentence with the utilisation of APIs, aprtilcaurly those from Google and EmailJS.<p>
 
### Surface
Given that the project is centered upon Tokyo, and its prevailing themes are anime, manga, and video games, I wanted an aesthetic that would remain "on brand". Tokyo, particularly its gaming and tech scene, is known for its neons and flashing lights. I wanted to incoprate that element into the site's design while preventing them from being too overpowering. Therefore, I opted for carefuly curated, theme-related images as background for the first and lst pages, separated by a respectable portion of blace space on the second page, to break up the wall of colour and prevent the aeshetic from being too jarring.<p>
 
### Skeleton
 <ul>
    <li>Landing Page</li>
    <li>About</li>
    <li>Skills</li>
    <li>Projects</li>
    <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

### Structure
[Here](wireframes) are a list of the wireframes I developed during the inital mock-up. They are quite self-explanatory and rudimentary, but they didn't need to be overly compelx. They merely needed to serve as a base for me to extrapolate upon. Two of the wireframes had to be redone because I was having trouble with creating responsive speechbubbles, so I opted for basic rectangles instead because they are far easier to make responsive. This is in reference to the about page and the projects page, so you will see two wireframes for each of those. 

### Features
<ul>
  <li>I opted to use a single page format to make navigation much simpler and intuitive, meaning the user doesn't need to click back and forth between pages.</li>
  <li>The default setting for the navbar seemed to create a very stark and jarring transition to whatever you clicked on. It wasn't a very smooth effect. So, I opted for a smooth scrolling effect instead of just appearing on whatever navbar item you click on, and this made for a much nicer, more fluid experience.</li>
  <li>I made the skill progress bars textured and animated because my research showed that it is often easier for colour-blind individuals to make out things that are textured and or moving on a screen.</li>
 <li>I created the footer to mirror the navbar in design, being black. This made for a very balanced and symmetrical visual experience when both were present and visible on the screen.</li>
 <li>I included social media links in the footer and added a small rotation and colour changing animation to help enhance their visibility and presence.</li>
</ul>

### Features left to implement
<ul>
  <li>I would like to develop a  better way to display my projects. As it is now, it isn't so bad because there aren't many to show. But, in the future, I will need to come up with a more econonic use of space in that section.</li>
  <li>I would like to add an education sections to display that information more clearly and give it its own section. As it is now, it's mentioned in the About section, but I feel it would stand out more if it were given its own place.</li>
  <li>I would like to improve the site's overall look by finding a more uniservsally suitable colour-scheme, because it became clear in the latter part of my testing phase that the pink I had chosen can appear very harsh for some people. An example of this is provided further below in the testing section of this readme.

I find that I am a visual learner i.e. I learn better by watching others do, so I used YouTube tutorials for help pertaining to certain things I find tricky, such as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23bpce-5s8I">nav bar</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woVuUbDOeMk&t=5s)">social media links</a><p></li> 
</ul>

## Testing
The first step of my testing began by using <a href="http://ami.responsivedesign.is/">Am I Responsive?</a> to deduce whether my project was indeed responsive and compatible across all devices, the results of which can be observed at the beginning of this readme in the responsiveness preview.

The second stage involved sharing the deployed link with a few colleagues and friends to double check whether it was actually responsive or not, and this is where I ran into a curious issue. It would seem that the particular shade of pink that I used may appear differently on different devices, and this will probably negatively impact visbility for effected users. Below you will a screenshot of what how the site appears to me and most users compared to another screenshot of how it appears to a select few.

This is what most users (myself included) see:

This is what a small number of users may see:
![Colour Difference 2](assets/img/colourdiff2.jpg)

This occurs regardless of using DevTools or sites like Am I Responsive. So, essentially, if the colour appears correctly for you, then it will do so no matter what medium you view it through. Unfortunately, the same is true vice versa. While I remain unsure what the exact cause of this is, it would appear that this is may be due to one's individual device settings. This issue does seem to be localised to the minority, meaning that for the average user the project should appear normally. But this finding has given me a note of improvement and points me towards something that I can work to make better in the future.

The third step of my testing involved the utilization of [Code Verifier](https://validator.w3.org/), which yielded the following result:

## Deployment
This site is hosted on GitHub pages and it's deployed directly using the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically when new commits are made and then pushed from VSCode. To deploy the site correctly, the landing page must be named 'index.html'.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting git clone https://github.com/kel151/1stmilestoneproject.git into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.
